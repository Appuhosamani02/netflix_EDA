## ðŸ“ŒKey Insights from Netflix EDA :
- Approximately 70% of the available content consists of movies, while TV shows make up the remaining 30%.
- The most frequent ratings are TV-MA (Mature Audiences) and TV-14, indicating that Netflix primarily focus on older teens and adults.

- Lower counts of TV-Y, TV-G, and PG-rated content suggest that family-friendly and childrenâ€™s programming is less dominant. This highlights an opportunity for expanding kid-friendly content to attract younger audiences.
- United states and India are the top-2 content producers
- The count of movies released each month is significantly higher than TV shows, with peaks in certain months suggesting planned series releases aligned with viewing trends, and a notable rise in both categories in the 12th month(December), likely due to holiday content strategies.
